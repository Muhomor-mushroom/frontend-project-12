1) This application is a slack chat. In this chat, the user is given the opportunity to log in as a specific user by entering a login and password.
2) For the application to work, it is necessary to download all the necessary dependencies. To do this, enter "npm install" in the console. After that, enter "make start" and wait for a response from the server and enter the url "http://0.0.0.0:5001" in the browser and go to the site.
3) First of all use the command 'make install && make build ' to install all dependencies
4) After that use the command 'make start' to run the application

This application demonstrates the basic operation of a chat, the analogue of which is the "slack" chat. When you go to the start page, you will be redirected to the main authorization page, where you can log in or register as a user. After that, you are given the opportunity to write in various chats, as well as change the names of these chats (except for the main ones) and delete these chats. The application also provides censorship of what is written. Thus, an obscene name will be replaced with "*", and obscene messages will be filtered. Enjoy using ^_^.
